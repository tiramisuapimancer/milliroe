Bepis-chan's leg flipped up and struck the phone in Kawaii Fucker's arms, sending it flying. Kawaii Fucker instinctually lashed out at
where Bepis-chan had been, but found nothing there- the momentum of the kick left her twisted in the strangest angle on the sand.
While she untangled herself from a position that would've certainly killed someone firm, like their group chat member, Wasp Mouse, 
Kawaii Fucker scanned the area for her phone.

It had landed in the water.

"Not gettin my FUCKIN account now, huh, huh?" Bepis-chan blurbled, cheer fading as she, too, realized the phone's location. "Goddamn."

Kawaii Fucker restrained herself from putting Bepis-chan into a headlock, and then unrestrained herself. "Asshole! Bitch! You're gonna
be the one grabbing it the instant you're outta this!" she screeched, Bepis-chan writhing.

"I'm not gonna goddamn die today. You can't even see where it is. It's nasty."

Kawaii Fucker's arms were now free for the shrugging, and she excercised the new freedom liberally along with a hearty snort. "Nobody's
gonna die touching that shit, it's been like forever since it was anything except gross, idiothat." 

Bepis-chan's rhinophores drooped slightly. "I mean- maybe I wouldn't die but I swear Bloodkitten's been looking a little greener every
day since I threw her in last beach party." 

"She's always been green."

"You know what I meant, bitch!"
